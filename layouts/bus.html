        Welcome aboard the working shell of <strong>509 Network</strong> — a mobile field unit based right here in the
        Tri-Cities region of Tennessee. It serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it’s a finely outfitted rig for <em>custom
        carpentry and professional blade sharpening</em>; on the other, it’s a deployable tech node for
        <em>critical client support, networking work, and field diagnostics</em>.

        Whether you're in Kingsport, Johnson City, Bristol, or just passing through the hills, there's a good chance the
        rig isn’t far. And if you caught a strange signal or a low electrical hum while driving by — that was probably just
        the inverter cooling down. Or the mesh router waking up.
